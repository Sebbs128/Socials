# Socials
Here you'll find links to my other sites, social media profiles, and projects.

If you notice an issue or even just want to discuss any of them, feel free to open up a new issue or discussion.

## Social Media Profiles

I'm not active on all them equally, and not everything is consistently visible. Ce la vie.

## Code projects
### Github

### Azure DevOps

Most projects here are private, but there are some that are public, and more will be made public (or moved to Github) when I either reach a certain level of confidence with them, or want them to be public.
